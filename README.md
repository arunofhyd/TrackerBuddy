## 🚀 Performance

This application was built with performance as a top priority. By using a modern buildless approach with optimized assets, it achieves perfect Lighthouse scores.

  </p>

-   **Optimized CSS:** A tiny, purged CSS file generated from Tailwind CSS ensures only the necessary styles are loaded.
-   **Compressed Assets:** All images have been converted to the modern `.webp` format, and the background video is highly compressed for fast loading.
-   **Lazy-Loaded Video:** The splash screen shows a static image first for an instant load, then progressively loads the video in the background.

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 Modules)
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via an optimized build)
-   **Backend & Database:** Firebase (Firestore for database, Firebase Authentication for users)
